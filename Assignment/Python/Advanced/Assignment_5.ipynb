    "Python does support the notion of name \"mangling\" (i.e., expansion) to localize some names in classes. Mangled names are sometimes misleadingly called \"private attributes,\" but really this is just a way to localize a name to the class that created it—name mangling does not prevent access by code outside the class. This feature is mostly intended to avoid namespace collisions in instances, not to restrict access to names in general; mangled names are therefore better called \"pseudoprivate\" than \"private.\"\n",

    "Pseudoprivate names are an advanced feature, when writing general tools or larger class hierarchies for use in multiprogrammer projects. Python programmers code internal names with a single underscore (e.g., \\_X), which is just an informal convention to let know that a name shouldn't be changed (it means nothing to Python itself)."
